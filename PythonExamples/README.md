# Python Examples with PYTSS

Now that tpm2_pytss is stable I've started collecting worked examples for some common situations, eg: reading PCRs, quotes etc.

tpm_pytss is here: https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-pytss

## Running the examples

First you will need a TPM, either a real TPM or the IBM SW TPM is a good substitute.

Each example can be run just by typing `python3 example.py`

## Available Examples

Each example has an accompanying description as markdown file, plus annotated code.

   * [quote](quote.md)
